# downloading_is_sick
why download if its available online......start remembering the links

who  likes to download lots of pdf..they make download folder a mess.

why not save the link to pdf somewhere in chrome itself and give it  a nickname for remembering purpose 

and whenever you need that pdf file again just query it by its nick name and chrome extension will show 

you its URL ...just load it on chrome
